= cmess - Assist with messed up encodings

== VERSION

This documentation refers to cmess version 0.0.1


== DESCRIPTION

CMess bundles several tools under its hood that aim at dealing with various
problems occurring in the context of character sets and encodings. Currently,
there are:

guess_encoding:: simple helper to identify the encoding of a given string
cinderella::     when characters are "double encoded", you can't easily
                 convert them back -- this is where cinderella comes in,
                 sorting the good ones into the pot and the (potentially)
                 bad ones into the crop...

TODO: well, more of the description... ;-)
